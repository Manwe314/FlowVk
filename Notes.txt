type of flow i think it should be:

flow::Instance instance = flow::MakeInstance() <- possibe tunable arguments?

flow::buffer numbersA = instance.getReadOnlyBuffer() <- definantly arguments here one of which is name to be used in glsl

numbersA.setValues(std::vector<int>{1, 1, 1,1, 1,}) <- support bunch of operations

*we do the same for numbersB*

instance.addPipeline() <- SPRV to use + pushconstants? Name!

instance.runSinglePipeline() <- name of the pipeline + array/list/vector of flow::buffers

must be able to set up a sequance of pipeline dispatches, support wavefront kenreling!

on glsl add support for preposses decoration:

@buffer[name="name", access="Read only", type="int", layout="std430"]

where name must match the argument name at creation. 


----------------

best support inital setup flexibility. device selection and extentions adding.

keep buffers modular + possibly have support for 2D images even 

safety with unique_PTR, size checks asserts and exceptions

potentially add support for vs code to highlight pipeline / SSBO names when using flow.

potentially add support for common operations.

have async dispach with std::future.



flow uogrades to do : 
	support more types of buffers and add image support
	support dynamic kernel entry name
	support custom set of set/binding
